Hello everyone,
In this stock simulator website I used Python and Taipy which is very useful for creating a website using Python.<br>
In basics.py I wrote a code for what a website looks like the first time and add some Hover effect and title of the website,
I attached the logo as well.<br>
In the receiver.py we have all the code for the website and it would receive the data from the user but here we have random data.<br>
In the sender.py we have code to send the data into the website.<br>
How to run? <br>
First of all Install taipy in your system.<br>
Run basics.py so the website is visible on the browser and after that run receiver.py and in another terminal run sender.py and then you can see the chart will be changed every 5 seconds (You can change the time).<br>
Thank you.
